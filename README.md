AI Tree for Pot Limit Omaha GTO Solutions

Overview

This project processes GTO (Game Theory Optimal) solved solutions for Pot Limit Omaha (PLO) poker and generates decision trees in JSON format. The trees provide human-readable insights from the solver data, making it easier to observe general rules, such as:

    •	Always bet a set.
    •	Bet good straight draws, check bad straight draws.

The decision trees are designed to be concise, typically around 40-60 lines, while retaining key strategic insights. The goal is to present GTO solutions in a more humanly processable form without losing much of the solver’s depth.

Input

The input is a CSV file, commonly generated from solvers, with the following format:

combo,weight
KcKs3s2s,100
KhKs3s2s,100
Jc3s2c2s,3
Jh3s2h2s,3
Kc3s2c2s,100
Kh3s2h2s,100

Each row represents a possible hand (card combo) and the associated weight or frequency that a player should take an action with that hand.

Features

    •	Decision Tree Generation: Converts raw solver output into a simplified decision tree format.
    •	Compact Representation: The algorithm optimizes for the smallest possible tree that still represents important GTO strategies.
    •	Human-Readable JSON: Outputs a nested JSON structure that can be used for visualization or further analysis.
    •	Strategic Insights: Offers a way to extract general rules from solver data, like “always bet a set.”

Here is a sample JSON output generated by the algorithm:
